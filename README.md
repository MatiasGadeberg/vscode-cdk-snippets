## Background

VSCode CDK snippets is a compilation of snippets created for personal usage over the last months + some extra useful snippets. The purpose of these snippets is to remove the burden of writing CDK resources scaffolds manually, automating the process and making the development cycle faster and less error prone.

## Install

Head to VSCode marketplace and search for "vscode-cdk-snippets"

## Usage

Snippets are designed to work with **Typescript language**. Thus, make sure to set correctly the filetype on VSCode.

Invoking a snippet can be done by directly typing the command prefix (or part of it), and IntelliSense will present the available options.

Alternatively, the snippets context can be invoked with _Ctrl + Space_

Once the snippet is selected, the cursor is placed on specific breakpoints. Fill these breakpoints and hit _Tab_ to head to the next one.

When available, snippets will present pre-defined values, specially for Typescript enumeration types. In this case, just use the arrow keys to select a value (or erase and type a custom one).

More information about VSCode snippets can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).
